# LoFi Pomodoro üéµ

Pomodoro timer with a LoFi music player created with HTML, CSS/SASS, and JavaScript.

This application implements the pomodoro technique and tells the user exactly when to work and when to take a break. You have 25-minute focus sessions followed by five-minute breaks and a longer 15-minute break after four consecutive focus sessions.

The pomodoro process:

- Start a 25-minute timer (pomodoro mode)
- Work until the timer rings
- Take a break for 5 minutes (short break mode)
- Every four pomodoros, take a longer break (15 minutes)

The user is able to use the music player to play lofi songs during the pomodoro sessions and breaks.

This project was a great way to learn more about the HTML5 Audio API and to practice JavaScript topics like DOM manipulation, event listeners, and timer functions (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`).
